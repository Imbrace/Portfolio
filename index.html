    <h2></h2>
     I am a postgraduate researcher at Coventry University and academic researcher specialising in technology and immersive digital media. I have worked on numerous interdisciplinary research projects ranging from EU Horizion to industry collaborations, contributing to technical development, research design, and the creation of interactive and public-facing digital outputs. This website is a portfolio of some of the larger Unity projects developed for various research outputs.

       This virtual reality experience challenged participants to solve four interconnected puzzles aboard a spaceship rapidly descending into a black hole. I served as the project lead, mentoring students I taught as they designed prototype puzzle concepts for the experience. I then refined and integrated each student’s work into a cohesive and fully realised VR experience.

The project was showcased at the Unconventional Convention, an event hosted by Coventry University in collaboration with Glued Marketing and Risk Evolves at the university’s Delia Derbyshire building. The experience was presented as a cooperative escape room, inspired by games such as Don’t Drop the Bomb, where a single player in VR navigated the puzzles while other participants, outside the headset, provided guidance using a physical guidebook.

        This project was created to present my PhD research at an immersive-themed research event at Coventry University. Instead of using a traditional poster or static display, I designed and rendered a virtual reality environment that functioned as a digital exhibition space. The VR experience presented key findings from my research and allowed me to deliver a short virtual presentation within the environment, offering attendees a more engaging and interactive way to explore the work.

       This project investigates the integration of sensor-driven data within game-based learning systems. As part of the work, I designed and implemented a location-aware gamified application that leverages real-world map data and real-time location tracking to monitor users’ train journeys. Players are able to collect virtual stamps at visited stations, using physical movement as a core interaction mechanic.

       This project is a prototype turn-based RPG that explores facial recognition as a core gameplay mechanic. Players control robots that draw power from their owners’ emotional expressions, using these emotions to influence combat against opposing robots. I developed a Python-based Flask server that captures the player’s facial input, evaluates emotional expressions using a trained machine-learning model, and outputs confidence scores. These values are then used in-game to determine both the elemental type of each attack and the resulting damage.

       The Gallery of Living History (GoLH) is a non-profit organisation dedicated to exploring themes of history, memory, and culture through research and creative practice. I was tasked to transform their analogue “Top Trumps”-style card game (featuring artwork of historical figures created by children from partner schools) into a digital version. The resulting game was designed for distribution on both PC and Mobile to be used at public events.
